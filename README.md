This is a very simple project using the LCM communication library to simulate V2V communication.

This program demonstrates how to do send and async receive on multiple threads using the openMP compiler extensions.

We use very simple equations to determine if any moving object (objects are publishing location and velocity vectors on the bus) would be on course to collision and do course corrections if necessary.
